Time-varying characteristics of the body's centre of mass and centre of pressure displacements along with electrical activity of muscles (EMG) are key parameters used to quantify the control of balance during standing and walking. While linear analysis is undertaken as a standard approach, non-linear methods have much to offer for drawing physiologically meaningful interpretations. Recently, we have developed a new framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) for studying impaired gait in patients with neurodegenerative disorders.

AI/ML",How do data-driven machine learning models that generate stable structures compare against conventional methods?,,Sudarshan Vijay,"Data-driven machine learning models are increasingly being used to generate stable atomic configurations. These models are trained on a database of stable structures computed using density functional theory (DFT). Based on this database, architectures such as the variational auto-encoder, generative adversarial networks and (more recently) the transformer learn an implicit probability distribution. This distribution is used to decide if a given configuration is stable. 

In contrast, conventional methods use global optimization techniques such as basin and minima hopping. These techniques traverse through the potential energy surface of a given atomic configuration while looking for stable (lowest energy) structures.

It is currently unclear if these data-driven machine learning models outperform conventional algorithms for the task of generating new stable structures for a fixed stoichiometry. In this work, we will apply available machine learning models as well as global optimization techniques to a few prototypical materials. We will benchmark stable structures generated by these methods and compare their time-to-solution.

AI/ML",Strategies for generating databases to effectively train machine learned interatomic potentials,,Sudarshan Vijay,"This project focuses on using computer simulations and machine learning to study chemical reactions in heterogeneous catalysis and electrochemistry. 

Very accurate simulations using methods such as density functional theory (DFT) are used to understand how atoms behave during reactions. These methods are predictive and accurate but take a lot of computing time and can only look at very small systems over very short times. 

In chemical processes, things happen over longer times and over larger length scales. Using machine learning methods, we can train models, called machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to accelerate DFT calculations. However, to make these models reliable, they must be trained on a good mix of atomic structures that reflect all the different ways atoms can be arranged.  In this project, we’ll explore two methods to help pick out the best atomic structures to train our models:
(1) Bayesian methods – which help estimate how confident the model is in its predictions.  (2) Committee methods with neural networks – where multiple models “vote” to decide what data is most useful to learn from.  

We’ll test these methods on materials like metal oxides and systems involving water and ions. By the end, we’ll compare both approaches to see which one works better and why.

CLIMATE STUDIES,Assessment of demand-side climate mitigation strategies,,Anjali Sharma,"The aim of this project is to examine how energy demand reduction measures can contribute to climate change mitigation. Absolute reduction in energy demand is gaining attention as a climate mitigation strategy. Although demand-side management of energy is not a new mitigation solution, it primarily focuses on the relative reduction in energy demand via efficiency improvements. This can be done by limiting energy demand using a mix of technological innovation, and social & institutional changes. 

But, the feasibility of achieving such high levels of efficiency improvements remains questionable as the study assumes historically unprecedented rates of improvements that are also prohibitively expensive (Semienuik et al., 2020). In this context, mitigation strategies focused on reducing absolute energy demand are gaining traction. These include ‘Degrowth’(Kallis et al., 2018) and ‘Energy Sufficiency’ (Darby and Fawcett, 2018). These strategies highlight a shift away from the dominant climate mitigation discussions that assume a continued growth in GDP and thus energy use to the ones where the overall GDP and energy levels are limited to levels that are enough for human well-being. 

This project will assess the ambition and feasibility of the emerging degrowth and sufficiency focused climate mitigation strategies, and their implications for human well-being and equitable climate mitigation. Scenarios assessed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SR1.5 and AR6 reports, as well as other secondary literature will be analysed in this project.

Ganesh,"Metamaterials are a class of artificially designed structures whose properties are a function of the constituent material, as well as the geometry/topology of the structure. For example, an auxetic 2D-Lattice subjected to a uniaxial stretch expands in the orthogonal direction, thereby demonstrating an effective “negative” Poisson’s ratio (in contrast, the constituent material has a positive Poisson’s ratio). Since the architecture or geometry plays an important role in the unconventional properties, Kirigami, the art of cutting paper to form 3-D shapes starting from 2-D sheets has been found to be quite relevant to the design of mechanical metamaterials. Specifically, application of load to a 2-D sheet architected with small cuts induces out-of-plane buckling of the individual links, and results in the introduction of bending stiffness to the structure (which is negligible in the uncut specimen due to its negligible thickness). An interesting application of these structures is in the field of soft robotics, where shape morphing is employed to elicit locomotion through deformation. However, most studies focus only on rectilinear locomotion.

PHYSICS,Imaging with Compton scattered photons in Positron emission tomography,,Prof. Pragya Das,"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an advance imaging technique in nuclear medicine.  The image quality suffers from various types of noises, of which Compton scattering is a major component in degrading the image quality.  In the conventional PET, Compton scattered part is carefully estimated and discarded from the main data.  With the advent of list-mode data collection, it is possible to isolate the scattered events because the locus of the scattering point lies on a prolate surface.  Our idea is to construct images using the scattered events and later merge them with the main data.  So, instead of discarding the scattered data as noise, we can utilize them, thereby improving the signal to noise ratio significantly.  Developing models is one part of our project, and to apply various deconvolution techniques to improve the image quality is another one.",2,"Students entering 3rd year, Students entering 4th/5th year",above 8,"Computer programming, C-language, MATLAB, Monte Carlo simulation",2-3 months,To gain knowledge in Physics and computational aspects of biomedical imaging techniques.,"Partly stay in campus (say, 3-4 weeks).",12 - 16 hours.,Academic honesty and keen desire to learn.
PHYSICS,Imaging with scattered photons with known time-of-flight in Positron emission tomography,,Prof. Pragya Das,"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an advance imaging technique in nuclear medicine.  Conventional PET employs various techniques to reject scattered data as it creates noise in the reconstructed image. Instead of discarding 30-60% of the coincidence events belonging to single-scattered (SS) category, we propose a novel algorithm that utilizes such events to generate images.  While previous studies in literature have explored SS imaging using both Time-of-Flight (TOF) and energy information, our approach extends this capability to plastic scintillators with only TOF information.  This proves particularly beneficial for low-count plastic PETs with very good timing resolution.  We plan to validate our model using experimental data from J-PET facility (Jagiellonian University, Poland).",1,Students entering 4th/5th year,above 8,"Computer programming, C-language, MATLAB, Monte Carlo simulation",2 - 3 months,Physics ideas utilized in Biomedical imaging,Partly stay in campus (say 3 - 4 weeks),12 - 16 hours,Academic honesty and keen desire to learn.

MULTIDISCIPLINARY",Gradient approaches to optimal function learning,,Debasish Chatterjee,"An open problem in signal processing posed in 1977 demanded a numerically viable algorithm to solve the optimal function learning (interpolation) problem. A solution was recently offered in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysconle.2023.105648 (arXiv version https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01304), building on some recent developments in convex semi-infinite programs. Such semi-infinite programs are NP hard; however, some NP hard problems admit excellent approximations, and the optimal function learning problem is one such. This project is directed at the development gradient approaches to solving the optimal function learning problem up to pre-assigned accuracy.

Preliminary results in this direction (using nonsmooth gradient methods) have demonstrated, on average, several hundred fold improvement in performance on 67 benchmark problems relative to state-of-the-art solvers. The ideas may be employed, among other things, to develop a new class of methods for signal in-painting, e.g., optimal inpainting for corrupted audio signals, etc.",3,Students entering 2nd year,above 8,Sufficient mathematical maturity and seriousness.
