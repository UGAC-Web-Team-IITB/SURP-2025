        "Project Description": "Vegetation monitoring using hyperspectral satellite imagery has become a vital tool in understanding ecosystem health, agricultural productivity, and biodiversity conservation. However, mixed pixels in satellite images often blur the spectral signals of vegetation with other land cover types, making it challenging to accurately assess vegetation abundance and distribution. This research focuses on assessment of different machine learning (ML)-based spectral unmixing algorithms tailored for vegetation pixels. Students can employ unsupervised ML for identifying the cluster of similar vegetation patterns followed by algorithms to unmix mixed spectral signals, for accurately identifying vegetation components, and producing high-resolution abundance maps. Applications include precision agriculture, and climate change impact studies.",

Time-varying characteristics of the body's centre of mass and centre of pressure displacements along with electrical activity of muscles (EMG) are key parameters used to quantify the control of balance during standing and walking. While linear analysis is undertaken as a standard approach, non-linear methods have much to offer for drawing physiologically meaningful interpretations. Recently, we have developed a new framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) for studying impaired gait in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. In this project, the focus will be to expand the application of TDA to characterize the control of standing balance in humans, in order to obtain a mechanistic understanding of postural instability and falls in older adults.",

        "Project Description": "The aim of this project is to examine how energy demand reduction measures can contribute to climate change mitigation. Absolute reduction in energy demand is gaining attention as a climate mitigation strategy. Although demand-side management of energy is not a new mitigation solution, it primarily focuses on the relative reduction in energy demand via efficiency improvements. This can be done by limiting energy demand using a mix of technological innovation, and social & institutional changes. \n\nBut, the feasibility of achieving such high levels of efficiency improvements remains questionable as the study assumes historically unprecedented rates of improvements that are also prohibitively expensive (Semienuik et al., 2020). In this context, mitigation strategies focused on reducing absolute energy demand are gaining traction. These include \u2018Degrowth\u2019(Kallis et al., 2018) and \u2018Energy Sufficiency\u2019 (Darby and Fawcett, 2018). These strategies highlight a shift away from the dominant climate mitigation discussions that assume a continued growth in GDP and thus energy use to the ones where the overall GDP and energy levels are limited to levels that are enough for human well-being. \n\nThis project will assess the ambition and feasibility of the emerging degrowth and sufficiency focused climate mitigation strategies, and their implications for human well-being and equitable climate mitigation. Scenarios assessed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SR1.5 and AR6 reports, as well as other secondary literature will be analysed in this project.\n",

These models are trained on a database of stable structures computed using density functional theory (DFT). Based on this database, architectures such as the variational auto-encoder, generative adversarial networks and (more recently) the transformer learn an implicit probability distribution. This distribution is used to decide if a given configuration is stable. \n\nIn contrast, conventional methods use global optimization techniques such as basin and minima hopping. These techniques traverse through the potential energy surface of a given atomic configuration while looking for stable (lowest energy) structures.\n\nIt is currently unclear if these data-driven machine learning models outperform conventional algorithms for the task of generating new stable structures for a fixed stoichiometry. In this work, we will apply available machine learning models as well as global optimization techniques to a few prototypical materials. We will benchmark stable structures generated by these methods and compare their time-to-solution.\n\nThis project is well suited for students interested in developing and applying machine learning models.

        "Project Description": "This project focuses on using computer simulations and machine learning to study chemical reactions in heterogeneous catalysis and electrochemistry. \n\nVery accurate simulations using methods such as density functional theory (DFT) are used to understand how atoms behave during reactions. These methods are predictive and accurate but take a lot of computing time and can only look at very small systems over very short times. \n\nIn chemical processes, things happen over longer times and over larger length scales. Using machine learning methods, we can train models, called machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to accelerate DFT calculations. However, to make these models reliable, they must be trained on a good mix of atomic structures that reflect all the different ways atoms can be arranged.  In this project, we\u2019ll explore two methods to help pick out the best atomic structures to train our models:\n(1) Bayesian methods \u2013 which help estimate how confident the model is in its predictions.  (2) Committee methods with neural networks \u2013 where multiple models \u201cvote\u201d to decide what data is most useful to learn from.  \n\nWe\u2019ll test these methods on materials like metal oxides and systems involving water and ions. By the end, we\u2019ll compare both approaches to see which one works better and why. ",

Such semi-infinite programs are NP hard; however, some NP hard problems admit excellent approximations, and the optimal function learning problem is one such. This project is directed at the development gradient approaches to solving the optimal function learning problem up to pre-assigned accuracy.\n\nPreliminary results in this direction (using nonsmooth gradient methods) have demonstrated, on average, several hundred fold improvement in performance on 67 benchmark problems relative to state-of-the-art solvers.

        "Project Description": "Metamaterials are a class of artificially designed structures whose properties are a function of the constituent material, as well as the geometry/topology of the structure. For example, an auxetic 2D-Lattice subjected to a uniaxial stretch expands in the orthogonal direction, thereby demonstrating an effective \u201cnegative\u201d Poisson\u2019s ratio (in contrast, the constituent material has a positive Poisson\u2019s ratio). Since the architecture or geometry plays an important role in the unconventional properties, Kirigami, the art of cutting paper to form 3-D shapes starting from 2-D sheets has been found to be quite relevant to the design of mechanical metamaterials. Specifically, application of load to a 2-D sheet architected with small cuts induces out-of-plane buckling of the individual links, and results in the introduction of bending stiffness to the structure (which is negligible in the uncut specimen due to its negligible thickness). An interesting application of these structures is in the field of soft robotics, where shape morphing is employed to elicit locomotion through deformation. However, most studies focus only on rectilinear locomotion. In this project, we will intend to explore the ability to achieve shape morphing and realize various modes of deformation-induced locomotion (such as bending/twisting) through a localized dynamic excitation and making it completely reversible.",

The image quality suffers from various types of noises, of which Compton scattering is a major component in degrading the image quality.  In the conventional PET, Compton scattered part is carefully estimated and discarded from the main data.  With the advent of list-mode data collection, it is possible to isolate the scattered events because the locus of the scattering point lies on a prolate surface.  Our idea is to construct images using the scattered events and later merge them with the main data.  So, instead of discarding the scattered data as noise, we can utilize them, thereby improving the signal to noise ratio significantly.  Developing models is one part of our project, and to apply various deconvolution techniques to improve the image quality is another one.",

Conventional PET employs various techniques to reject scattered data as it creates noise in the reconstructed image. Instead of discarding 30-60% of the coincidence events belonging to single-scattered (SS) category, we propose a novel algorithm that utilizes such events to generate images.  While previous studies in literature have explored SS imaging using both Time-of-Flight (TOF) and energy information, our approach extends this capability to plastic scintillators with only TOF information.  This proves particularly beneficial for low-count plastic PETs with very good timing resolution.  We plan to validate our model using experimental data from J-PET facility (Jagiellonian University, Poland).",
